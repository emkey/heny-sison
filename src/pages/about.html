				<p class="text-large">Driven by founder Heny Sison’s sheer love for the craft and sharing her passion with others, we formally established a school of Cake Decorating and Baking in 1985. We were born from humble beginnings, from a converted garage where friends and neighbors would drop by to take classes. Since then, the school has expanded its course offerings to a significantly wider range of culinary and lifestyle programs. In 2003, we were eventually renamed as the Heny Sison Culinary School, now a nationally recognized, full-fledged culinary institution.</p>
