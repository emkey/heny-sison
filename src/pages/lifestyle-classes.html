				<p>The Heny Sison Culinary School began by conducting Lifestyle Classes, which are mostly one-day-long workshops or lecture-demo classes on a number of select cooking and baking techniques. We repeat certain Lifestyle Classes every month or every other month, depending on the feedback from our students. Through time, we have continually added new and interesting Lifestyle Classes to stay abreast with food trends and developments. If youâ€™re looking for a fun, informative way to master certain culinary methods, our Lifestyle Classes may be for you.</p>
