				<p>If you’re interested in a more in-depth culinary experience, our comprehensive Essential Series program is a great start. We offer two Certification courses—the Baking and Pastry Arts Series (EBPS), and the (ECS).  Both use a techniques-based curriculum with a hands-on experience that are designed to equip you with the know-how to utilize your craft and talents professionally.  Our acclaimed instructors will teach you the basic theoretical foundations so that by the end of this series, you will be able to develop your own recipes and build a strong practical skill set in the kitchen.</p>
				
				<p>Our Essential Series is an intensive 22 or 23-day program.  We offer two modules for the schedule of the Essential Series: the weekday module with classes held every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday; and the weekend module with classes held every Saturday.</p>
				
				<p>Every course ends with a culminating event or the graduation, where students will get to prepare all the meals for a celebratory lunch or dinner with their respective guests.  The graduation is usually an emotional last day, as the students put their newly learned skills to the test, and say goodbye to the new friends that they have gained along the way.  On this day, we give the Silver Spoon Award to deserving outstanding students who have shown an undying passion and impressive growth in their performance throughout the course.</p>
